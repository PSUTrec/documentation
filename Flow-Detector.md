## Flow Detectors

The flow detector links the _Detector_ information with _Flow_. The required parameters for _Flow Detectors_ are:

* latitude and longitude of the flow detector location

If a GPS unit is not available to determine the location of a flow detector use Google Earth to determine an approximate location. In most cases, there is one flow detector associated with one flow; however, multiple flow detectors can be associated with one flow when automated counters are changed, or comparisons among different types of detectors are being tested.

Additional optional attributes associated with _Flow Detector_ are:

* start date
* stop date
* eco channel ID
