Bicycle and pedestrian counts are used by transportation agencies to support a variety of analyses. They are used to measure facility usage, compare patterns, check counters and equipment, in before / after studies, etc. The data obtained from BPP can help support these activities. 

### Comparing Patterns


### Equipment Checks

Identify outlier data with graphs of the raw data:

In the Explore Data interface, outliers can be identified once the data are plotted. In the example below, the month of July 2016 shows extremely high pedestrian counts for the Key Bridge Southbound volumes. Plotting the data can help point out erroneous data. This can allow agencies to look at the data and determine the source of the error. It may be a one time issue, or it may point to issues with the equipment. 

### Before/After Studies

Tell the story of how funds have been used, tell before and after stories
