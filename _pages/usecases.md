Bicycle and pedestrian counts are used by transportation agencies to support a variety of analyses. They are used to measure facility usage, compare patterns, check counters and equipment, in before / after studies, etc. The data obtained from BPP can help support these activities. 

### Comparing Patterns
Agencies use bicycle volumes to understand travel behavior and the effect of days of the week, seasonal variations, and the impact of weather. It's helpful to understand the patterns to discern commute trips from recreation.

### Equipment Checks

Identify outlier data with graphs of the raw data:

In the Explore Data interface, outliers can be identified once the data are plotted. In the example below, the month of July 2016 shows extremely high pedestrian counts for the Key Bridge Southbound volumes. Plotting the data can help point out erroneous data. This can allow agencies to look at the data and determine the source of the error. It may be a one time issue, or it may point to issues with the equipment.

### Before/After Studies

Before and after studies are important to understand the impact of infrastructure investment. In the classic sense, "if you build it they will come" rings true for safer bicycle infrastructure. Accurate short duration counts that can be extrapolated are a key to tellng this story. Once downloaded, you can use techniques such as cluster analysis to better understand the travel patterns.
