<b>Policies for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives.</b>

Similar to the preceding section, here you should identify any potential limitations on the data requestorâ€™s ability to re-use or re-distribute the data or materials. This could be because of the sort of sensitivity identified above or because the source of some of the data collected for the project has placed limitations on the re-distribution of those data and materials.  Be sure to review any applicable agreements with such parties to determine the extent of re-use and re-distribution you are allowed to guarantee in your DMP. 

In some rare cases, PIs will want to license the re-use or distribution of the data. If this is the case, the following applies. DOT uses the standards laid out in OMB Memorandum M-13-13, which indicates a strong preference for the use of Creative Commons licenses. PIs will have the option of setting conditions on the re-use of their materials by affixing a permission and copyright license statement, including a Creative Commons License to their work. If you will be enforcing terms of use or a requirement for data citation through a license, indicate as much in your DMP. Describe any other legal requirements that might need to be addressed.
