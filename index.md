BikePed Portal is the leading national non-motorized count archive. Currently, the archive includes automated and manual counts from across the country and supports counts collected on road and path segments. The archive allows users to upload, view, and download data. It was established in 2015, by researches at Portland State University through a pooled fund grant administered by the National Center for Transportation and Communities (NITC). Other project partners include the Federal Highway Administration, Oregon Department of Transportation, Metro, Lane Council of Governments, Central Lane MPO, Bend MPO, Mid-Willamette Valley Council of Governments, Rogue Valley Council of Governments, City of Boulder, City of Austin, Cycle Oregon, and Oregon Community Foundation.
