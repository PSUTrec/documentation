title: Pedestrian Estimated Volumes From Push Button Actuations
---

The pedestrian estimated volumes from push button actuations is now available on BikePed Portal. The model and research supporting this work was conducted for Oregon DOT by Kothuri et al. (2024). The final report can be found [here](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/73447).  
  
The following sections will guide you through the different tools available on the [_Push Button Actuations_](https://bikeped.trec.pdx.edu/pushbutton/) page.  

### Step 1: Selecting your station(s) of interest
There are two ways to select your station(s) of interest: 1) select by clicking on the different locations on the map, and 2) select by using the filtering options on the metadata table.

__Selecting by using the map__  
The map viewing boundary is set at the state level. The number within each circle icon indicates the number of locations that are available within that area. As you zoom in, the circle icons will disaggregate into more circle icons as the location of the intersections become more accurate. Each time you select a station by clicking on a circle icon, the icon will change to a light blue color and a list of stations representing that icon will show up on the right sidebar under "Stations View" (Fig. 1).

    <figcaption>Fig. 1: Within the purple box on the map, the selected circle icon, in blue, represents 14 intersections within that area. The right sidebar lists all 14 stations by name under "Stations View".</figcaption>

From the "Stations View" sidebar, click on the "+" to add it to the "Analysis Stations" for futher analysis and visualizations (Fig. 2). The selected stations for further analysis will change the circle icons on the map from blue to purple. To unselect a station from the "Analysis Stations", click the "-" button located under the station name.
