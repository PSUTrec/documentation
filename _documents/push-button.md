title: Pedestrian Estimated Volumes From Push Button Actuations
---

The pedestrian estimated volumes from push button actuations is now available on BikePed Portal. The model and research supporting this work was conducted for Oregon DOT by Kothuri et al. (2024). The final report can be found [here](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/73447).  
  
The following sections will guide you through the different tools available on the [_Push Button Actuations_](https://bikeped.trec.pdx.edu/pushbutton/) page.  

### Step 1: Selecting your station(s) of interest
There are two ways to select your station(s) of interest: A) select by clicking on the different locations on the map, and B) select by using the filtering options on the metadata table.

__A) Selecting by using the map__  
The map viewing boundary is set at the state level. The number within each circle icon indicates the number of locations that are available within that area. As you zoom in, the circle icons will disaggregate into more circle icons as the location of the intersections become more accurate. Each time you select a station by clicking on a circle icon, the icon will change to a light blue color and a list of stations representing that icon will show up on the right sidebar under "Stations View" (Fig. 1).

    <figcaption>Fig. 1: Within the purple box on the map, the selected circle icon, in blue, represents 14 intersections within that area. The right sidebar lists all 14 stations by name under "Stations View".</figcaption>
</figure>

From the "Stations View" sidebar, click on the "+" to add it to the "Analysis Stations" for futher analysis and visualizations (Fig. 2). The selected stations for further analysis will change the circle icons on the map from blue to purple. To unselect a station from the "Analysis Stations", click the "-" button located under the station name.

    <figcaption>Fig. 2: Within the purple box on the map, the selected "Analysis Stations" are highlighted in purple and the selected "Stations View" are highlighted in light blue. The right sidebar shows the lists of the selected "Analysis Stations" and "Stations View"; note the "+" or "-" buttons under the station names. </figcaption>

__B) Select by using the "Metadata" table filters__  
The second way to select stations is to use the "Metadata" table filters. To get to the "Metadata" table, click on the "graph" icon in the lower left corner of the map (Fig. 3). Once you click on the "graph" icon, a bottom panel will pop up with three labeled tabs.

    <figcaption>Fig. 3: The "graph" icon is located on the map in the lower left corner. Click on the "graph" icon to get to the data visualization tools and the metadata table. </figcaption>
</figure>

By selecting the "Metadata" tab, a metadata table for all the stations will be displayed along with the filter menu options on the left sidebar (Fig. 4).

    <figcaption>Fig. 4: The bottom panel pop up is selected to show the "Metadata" tab. The purple circles highlight the filter menu option along the left sidebar, the "+ add to analysis stations" button, and the search bar.</figcaption>
</figure>

The bottom panel can be expanded moving the mouse cursor to the upper edge of the panel and then clicking to drag the panel up or down. You can either use the search window located in the upper right of the metadata panel, or use the filter options on the left sidebar of the panel to find the stations of interest. To add stations from the metadata table to the "Analysis Station" selection, click on the "+ add to analysis stations" button located at along the top border of the panel. You will also notice additional options to display the selected stations on the map, examine the data availability, and to download the metadata table in a variety of formats.
