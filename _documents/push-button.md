title: Pedestrian Estimated Volumes From Push Button Actuations
---

The pedestrian estimated volumes from push button actuations is now available on BikePed Portal. The model and research supporting this work was conducted for Oregon DOT by Kothuri et al. (2024). The final report can be found [here](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/73447).  
  
The following sections will guide you through the different tools available on the [_Push Button Acutuations_](https://bikeped.trec.pdx.edu/pushbutton/) page.  

### Step 1: Selecting your station(s) of interest
There are two ways to select your station(s) of interest: 1) select by clicking on the different locations on the map, and 2) select by using the filtering options on the metadata table.

#### Selecting by using the map
The map viewing boundary is set at the state level. The number within each circle icon indicates the number of locations that are available within that area. As you zoom in, the circle icons will disaggregate into more circle icons as the location of the intersections become more accurate. Each time you select a station or a circle icon that maybe represent several stations, a list of stations are provided on the right sidebar under "Stations View" (Fig. 1).
