## Selecting the count station locations

### I want to explore...
You will first need to select if you want to explore by organization, region, or state. Users are limited to exploring data they have direct access to. For example, if you're an organization that is part of an established regional partnership, you will have access to view your organization's data and the data from all participating partners in the region. Once you've made your selections under the "I want to explore..." menu and click "Explore", the map will reorient to your geographical selection.
