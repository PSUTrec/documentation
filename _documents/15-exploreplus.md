## Selecting the count station locations

### I want to explore...
You will first need to select if you want to explore by organization, region, or state (Fig. 2). Users are limited to exploring data they have direct access to. For example, if you're an organization that is part of an established regional partnership, you will have access to view your organization's data and the data from all participating partners in the region. Once you've made your selections under the "I want to explore..." menu and click "Explore", the map will reorient to your geographical selection.

    <figcaption>Fig. 2: The right sidebar contains several menu options for selecting count station locations. Each of the menus in the right sidebar can be expanded or closed by clicking on the arrow icon next to the menu title as shown with the yellow arrow. This example shows the National Capital Region and all the count station locations owned by multiple agencies within this region.</figcaption>

Once you've selected the jurisdictional level of data to explore, you can now explore what count station locations are available and decide which count stations you are specifically interested in.

Some location icons include a number. This indicates the number of count lactions available within that area. As you zoom into the map, the icons will disaggregate into their respective locations.

### Station Health and Data Availability
The Station Health filters provides a high level overview of how much data are available at each count station location. Data availability is calculated as the number of observations recorded and received divided by the number of expected records (daily). For example, if a count location expects hourly data the expected number of observations is 24 within a day. If a specific count location only has 18 recorded observations, then the data availabilty would be 75%. The filters available are "Start Date", "End Date", and "Health Scale". The "Health Scale" is adjustable depending on how you define what is "good" (green), "suspicious" (yellow), or "bad" (red). You will be able to set the threshold values for "good", "suspicious", and "bad" using the sliders under the "Station Health" option (Fig. 3). Once you've defined these filters and click update, the map will update accordingly. You will also be able to define the date range of data of interest.

Once your thresholds are set you can click on a single or multiple stations of interest. Each station selected will show up under "Stations View" in the right sidebar. To view the data availability, click on the colored bar with the star that indicates the data availabilty for the date range (Fig. 4).

As with almost all figures, if you want to zoom into a specific date range on the figure you can click and drag the area of interest. To reset the zoom to the original x-axis range, click on the "Reset Zoom" button in the upper right corner of the figure (Fig. 5).

The figure on the right shows how the data appears once you've selected an area to zoom into by clicking and dragging the area of interest. To reset the figure to its original date range, click the "Reset Zoom" button.</figcaption>
