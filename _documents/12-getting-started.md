title: "Adding Manual or Short-Term Duration Counts"
---

If your are interested in using BikePed Portal to archive and display short-term or manual count data for your program at little to no cost, contact us as bikepedportal@pdx.edu.  
  
For us to host your manual or short-term duration count data, you will need to:
* [Fill out this agreement form](https://forms.gle/RudtMPgexBsQMsqm9)
* [Provide the metadata using this form](https://psutrec.github.io/documentation/assets/downloads/metadata-template.xlsx)
* [Provide the data using this form](https://psutrec.github.io/documentation/assets/downloads/data-template.xlsx)  
  
Instructions on how to fill and format the metadata and data files are provided in the next two sections. If at any point you have any questions, contact us.  We strongly recommend you read through the next two sections describing the metadata and data format before you get started as there is a lot of information regarding the miminum required metadata and the required format for count data.  
  
We also have a video tutorial posted [here](https://youtu.be/zN9yAcjNTaw) that provides the overall framework of the metadata and data, and an example of how to format and complete the metadata and data files for manual and short-term duration counts.
