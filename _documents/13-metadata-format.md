title: "Metadata for Manual Counts"
---

Metadata is the data about the location of where counts are being observed. The more metadata that is provided, the more context is given about the location. The _metadata\_template.xlsx_ file contains two worksheets described as "Required" and "Optional". In BikePed Portal, there is a set number of required attributes and a number of optional attributes that can also be included.  
  
Each column is named by a category and a descriptive attribute. For example, `segment_area.name` indicates that the attribute belongs to a category `segment_area` with the specific attribute of `name`; any attribute that is associated with the facility (e.g. roadway, sharrow, bike lane, sidewalks, west side of the side walk, etc.) will have a column name that starts with `facilties` with an attribute name associated with the `facilities` category (e.g. `facilities.pavement`). There is extensive documentation and examples of each attribute is defined under the _Framework_ documentation section (see sidebar menu) for each major category.
