title: "Detectors"
---
Multiple flows can be detected by a single detector within a certain facility of a segment area. Additionally, detectors are decoupled from a segment area to allow for detector devices to move multiple times in multiple areas.

Required parameters for _Detectors_ are:

* Jurisdiction
* Description
* Short Name

Optional parameters are:
* Serial Number
* Make
* Model
* Automated

If counts are detected by an automated counter, the Serial Number, Make, and Model should be recorded in the event the automated counter is re-used for a different flow, facility, or segment area; and to monitor the functional status of the counter.

If counts are manually recorded then the Make or Model field should be filled with "Manual".
