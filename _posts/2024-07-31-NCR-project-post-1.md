For the past couple of years we have been working with UNC and VT on the National Capital Region Trail Monitoring and Analysis Program. The program is funded by the National Parks Service and consists of several regional partners within the DC, MD, and VA region.

To learn more about the project, check out [our article about the project](https://trec.pdx.edu/news/washington-dc-data-dashboard-comes-bikeped-portal) and the project's [homepage](https://www.hsrc.unc.edu/our-work/ncr-trail-monitoring-and-analysis-program/).
